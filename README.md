# BNO055
This code is used for the BNO055 breakout board and a PICO. Functions need to be added for the gyro and the magometer. A temperature sensor is also one of the sensors on this board and can be used.
TODO: add code so that the accelerometer output data values are in m/s not random as they are now.
